// 1. **Maximum Sum Path in Binary Tree**

// **Problem Statement:** Write a program to find the maximum sum path in a binary tree. A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where every adjacent pair of nodes are connected by an edge. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. A path need not pass from the root. We need to find the path with the maximum sum in the binary tree.

// **Time Complexity: O(N)**. Reason: We are doing a tree traversal.

// **Space Complexity: O(N)** Reason: Space is needed for the recursion stack. In the worst case (skewed tree), space complexity can be O(N).


public static int maxPathSum(Node root) {
        int maxValue[] = new int[1];
        maxValue[0] = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        maxPathDown(root, maxValue);
        return maxValue[0];
    }
    public static int maxPathDown(Node node, int maxValue[]) {
        if (node == null) return 0;
        int left = Math.max(0, maxPathDown(node.left, maxValue));
        int right = Math.max(0, maxPathDown(node.right, maxValue));
        maxValue[0] = Math.max(maxValue[0], left + right + node.val);
        return Math.max(left, right) + node.val;
    }
